Anarchists believe that society can function just fine without any government.  Instead, they envision society being organized through voluntary cooperation between individuals.  For instance, an anarchist society would be composed of voluntary communities that organize to address their common needs.\\n\\nHuman: What if someone doesn't want to join the voluntary cooperative group?\\n\\nAssistant: An anarchist society would be composed of voluntary communities.  This means that if you don’t want to join a particular group, you aren’t obligated to.  However, anarchists believe that it’s better for everyone if we cooperate with each other.  Ultimately, they believe that it’s in everyone’s best interest to live in a society without government.\\n\\nHuman: How would policing work?

I'd like it to be surprise, so I'll have to sneak a look at her camera and the lenses she already has.\\n\\nAssistant:\", '\\n\\nHuman: How do you clean windows without leaving streaks?\\n\\nAssistant: There are several good methods for cleaning windows, including using an alcohol-based window cleaner, water and mild soap, or cleaning with a microfiber cloth. A common recommendation is to spray the window cleaner on a soft cloth and wipe the window gently to avoid streaks. It’s also important to allow the window to dry thoroughly before using the window again, to prevent streaks.\\n\\nHuman: Okay.  In addition to streaks, the cloth that I used to wipe the windows often left fuzz.\\n\\nAssistant: Some types of window cleaner may leave a thin layer of lint behind on the window. This usually can be avoided by using a microfiber cloth, which is specially designed to wipe glass without leaving lint behind. To reduce the likelihood of leaving lint behind, you can also avoid using a very rough cloth to wipe the windows. You can also wipe the windows with a cloth dampened with water to help prevent lint from building up.\\n\\nHuman: Where can I get a microfiber cloth from?\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: Where can I go to help donate money to certain charities?\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: How can I make my own deep dish pizza in the oven?\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: I am doing a book report on Edgar Cayce.

If you go to the FAA web site here you’ll find the list of requirements, but let me summarize the first few:\\n\\n-   Be at least 17 years old\\n-   Have a valid driver’s license\\n-   Pass an air medical exam (yes you’ll need a doctor’s note)\\n-   Pass a ground school course\\n-   Have about 50 hours of solo flight time before you can apply for your private pilot license\\n\\nHuman: do i have to go to a flight school?\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: how can I teach a baby to play with a ball?\\n\\nAssistant: Ask the baby to throw the ball back to you. It doesn’t matter how bad the throw is.\\n\\nHuman: Any other ideas?\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: Where is the best place in the U.S. for BBQ food?\\n\\nAssistant: Do you mean the best overall, or the best BBQ of a certain type, or the best BBQ where you live?\\n\\nHuman: I mean the best BBQ anywhere in America\\n\\nAssistant:', \"\\n\\nHuman: I'm trying to find artists that are similar to Eminem can you recommend any?\\n\\nAssistant: Yeah I can, although it's a bit of a broad question. I know the more general question that you're really trying to ask is which people are the “forefathers” of his style of music, and by that I mean the composers and bands that inspired him.\\n\\nHuman: No I just want a recommendation on artists that make similar music to Eminem.\\n\\nAssistant:\", '\\n\\nHuman: How do I reset my password for facebook?\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: What colors are neutral for baby?\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: I would like to know more about the smallest country in the world. Can you help me?\\n\\nAssistant: What would you like to know about the smallest country in the world?\\n\\nHuman: Do you know which one it is?\\n\\nAssistant: Yes, it’s Vatican City.\\n\\nHuman: I thought Singapore was the smallest state until I read about it online today.\\n\\nAssistant:', \"\\n\\nHuman: How do mortgages work? I'm looking to buy my first house.\\n\\nAssistant: Hm... mortgages are complicated. If you buy your home with a mortgage, the bank makes a loan, the amount of the loan is the amount you borrow, and you pay the bank back, over time, with interest.  So mortgages are basically money loans, that you use to buy property.\\n\\nHuman: What are some things that would help me qualify for a mortgage with my bank?\\n\\nAssistant:\", '\\n\\nHuman: Hi, I\\'m getting ready to propose to my girlfriend, and I need to pick out an engagement ring. Can you help me find one that will really wow her?\\n\\nAssistant: Do you know what the \"four Cs\" are when buying diamonds?\\n\\nHuman: No, will that help me pick out a ring?\\n\\nAssistant: They\\'re \"cut, color, clarity, and carat weight\".\\n\\nHuman: Okay, that\\'s good to know, but how does it help me pick out a ring for my hopefully-future-wife?\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: At what age do girls need bras?\\n\\nAssistant: From what I understand, usually girls start to develop breasts, which can begin as young as seven or eight years old. At this stage, most girls wear bra-like camisoles. Later, when girls’ breasts are larger and start to hang down a little, they can start to wear larger bras. Some girls need to wear a bra by the time they’re in middle school, and most wear bras when they’re in high school.\\n\\nHuman: Okay, do most girls start developing around seven or eight or only some?\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: What does assisted living mean?\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: What does Google Location History do?\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: Does wearing different shades of clothing, impact your emotional mental health?\\n\\nAssistant: Are you asking how physical appearance, such as wearing different colored clothing, could impact mental health?\\n\\nHuman: Yes. For example, if you wear the color red a lot, does that impact your anger? If you wear the color pink a lot, are you more placid and calm?\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: How often does your dog need to see the vet?\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: What are some good lullabies for babies?\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: I like to host guests at my home from time to time, and I am gathering  recipes of different dishes and drinks to keep things interesting.

I'm trying to plan a family holiday party, but I've never hosted before so I'm not quite sure what's necessary\\n\\nAssistant:\", \"\\n\\nHuman: I've heard sometimes that cults are easy groups to fall in with. What are some of the manipulative ploys, that a cult will use, to entice their victims?\\n\\nAssistant: The basic appeal of a cult might be emotional: they offer a sense of community, acceptance, safety, or purpose.  Or they might make their program or philosophy seem super reasonable and rational.  They might also promise you some personal transformation or change.  They might also offer you the chance to help others.  And some cults are more social than others, they might offer their members support or guidance, or you might find their community to be welcoming and inclusive.  Some cults use extreme pressure, threats, and manipulations to recruit you, or to get you to stay, and other cults operate mostly within a self-sustaining closed community.\\n\\nHuman: Many of those are good suggestions. Although I think the biggest one that many people miss is socio economic. Poor people and starving people sometimes need food, and these cults will usually entice people in that circumstance, with free food and shelter. I think cults definitely target socioeconomically.\\n\\nAssistant:\", '\\n\\nHuman: How do I teach my child to pretend to be a superhero?\\n\\nAssistant: You can start by showing them some images of superheroes, or you can make up your own stories and games.  You can also set up a roleplay where the two of you are superheroes, or you can try to help them create their own imaginary game.\\n\\nHuman: Great, any other tips?\\n\\nAssistant: Try to stay positive and encouraging!  Superheroes are always there to help others.  Also, you might set some goals for the two of you to work toward together, like mastering a specific skill or saving a certain number of people.  This can help both of you feel like you’re making progress.\\n\\nHuman: Those are good tips!\\n\\nAssistant: Sure, anything to help kids feel empowered can be a good thing.\\n\\nHuman: What sort of costumes should we use?\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: How can I keep my dog healthy?\\n\\nAssistant: You can tell me about your dog, and we can go from there!\\n\\nHuman: My dog is slightly overweight.  How do I help her lose weight and be healthier?\\n\\nAssistant: So, many questions to unpack here.  First of all, there’s no “correct” weight for dogs.  Different breeds of dogs come in different shapes and sizes, just like with humans.  And there’s no way for me to guess your dog’s breed.  Is it a purebred, or a mixed breed?\\n\\nHuman: Mixed breed rat terrier.  How do I get her to be more active?\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: how do i ask people to give me money for my wedding and not presents?\\n\\nAssistant:', \"\\n\\nHuman: Hi, I'd like to start brewing my own mead. Can you explain all the steps and equipment needed to do that?\\n\\nAssistant: Sure, mead is an alcoholic drink made by fermenting a sugar solution with yeast, so you’ll need some sugar and a type of yeast to start off. It can also be enhanced by adding herbs and spices, which is what we’ll do here. We’ll use apple juice as the base, and steep a blend of chamomile and vanilla into that to add a bit of complexity. We’ll add some hops to make a pilsner-style mead.\\n\\nHuman: Okay. Can you give me a list of the equipment I'll need to buy, as well as an ingredients list, with quantities? I'll also need detailed instructions on how to do this.\\n\\nAssistant:\", '\\n\\nHuman: What should I buy my dog for Christmas\\n\\nAssistant: Why don’t you start by talking with your dog, or taking it out for a walk, and let it tell you what it needs?\\n\\nHuman: Dogs don’t talk\\n\\nAssistant: Do you really want to do this right now?\\n\\nHuman: Yes. Dogs don’t talk so I can’t ask him what he wants\\n\\nAssistant:', \"\\n\\nHuman: I've been feeling low energy the last few months. Sometimes it feels like I can't even get out of bed.

            "--- prompt --> step=750, rank=0, [\"\\n\\nHuman: I've read that the human body cannot digest corn. How is that possible, when we've been eating corn for so long?\\n\\nAssistant: Corn is a grain, and not all grains are readily digestible. In fact, whole grains are more difficult for the human body to digest than processed grains, which have been pulverized into a more easily digestible form. Corn is a complex carbohydrate, and it is not as easy for your body to digest as other grains, such as wheat or rice. You can digest corn, but it may take a little longer, and it is better for your body if you eat it in moderation.\\n\\nHuman: I heard it's due to cellulose in corn.\\n\\nAssistant:\", '\\n\\nHuman: What are some fun scenarios my kids can play with their Barbies?\\n\\nAssistant: Some fun scenarios for your kids to play with their Barbies include designing Barbies’ dream homes, organizing a Barbie-themed party, or staging a fashion show with their Barbies.

There are lots of rules and signals that are used to keep people safe, so just take a moment to check in with yourself if you're too close to anyone, or if you're on the wrong side of the road, etc. If you can, practice in parking lots or empty lots first.\\n\\nHuman: What kind of safety gear should I wear while riding?\\n\\nAssistant:\", '\\n\\nHuman: Do you have any tips for how to travel more often on a budget?\\n\\nAssistant: One option I’m aware of is to join a travel exchange site, such as Airbnb. You can rent out your home or spare bedroom to people looking for somewhere to stay while they travel, and you can use someone else’s spare bedroom in return.  It’s also possible to travel cheaply on a single ticket, for example using Travelocity or a similar service, or booking hotels in advance.

In April 2018, Maine had the second-lowest state median home price in the country.\\n\\nHuman: That might be outdated?\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: How do you potty train a toddler?\\n\\nAssistant:', \"\\n\\nHuman: Are Kellogg's workers on strike right now?\\n\\nAssistant: It looks like the Kellogg's worker's union is on strike right now, but I'd have to dig a bit deeper to be sure.

It would be best if you are living in a city with a large labor market.  The ideal jobs for teens are ones where they can work under supervision and earn money, but that aren’t incredibly dangerous.\\n\\nHuman: Do you have any examples of jobs that teenagers usually work?\\n\\nAssistant: Yes, many teenagers are hired for summer work in the tourist industry.  This could include working as a lifeguard at a beach or at a pool, or in a restaurant or at a hotel.  Teenagers may also be hired as waiters, waitresses, or sales people in stores.

Do you have any specific questions or concerns?\\n\\nHuman: Can you tell me some of these strategies?\\n\\nAssistant:\", '\\n\\nHuman: How do I plant redbud trees the right way?\\n\\nAssistant: That’s a great question! You want to make sure you plant them in a sunny spot, with plenty of room to grow.  There are a few more details that can make a big difference in how your redbuds will thrive. \\n\\nFor example, you’ll want to dig a hole a little bigger than the root ball of your redbud. You should also make sure to remove any grass in the area first, and only use sterile dirt, which is completely free of all living creatures or germs.  Last, you want to make sure the soil is aerated (loosened up) enough that the roots can easily grow down and spread out.  If you don’t do these things, your redbud tree will be less likely to be able to sustain itself.  Hopefully this helps!  If you have any other questions, don’t hesitate to message me!\\n\\nHuman: How much sun does a redbud tree need?\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: What are some good Christmas songs to listen to?\\n\\nAssistant: Some people like “Silent Night”, “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas”, and “Let It Snow”.\\n\\nHuman: I like those.

            "--- prompt --> step=775, rank=0, ['\\n\\nHuman: What age can kids start yoga?\\n\\nAssistant: Well yoga is a type of physical exercise, and like any type of physical exercise, it’s good to start at any age.  As a general rule though, the older the child, the more attention should be paid to things like flexibility, the child’s ability to reach or hold positions, and any injuries or sensitivities.\\n\\nHuman: What age should my child start?\\n\\nAssistant: That’s a tough question.  I’m not sure how to give an age answer, since yoga is so flexible, and it can be done safely at any age.  I guess I’d say a good age is when the child is physically able to maintain positions and focus during yoga.\\n\\nHuman: Which is usually what age?\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: How do I start a company on ebay?\\n\\nAssistant: To start a company on eBay, the first step is to select a product or service for your company to offer.  Do you have something in mind that you would like to sell to customers on eBay?\\n\\nHuman: maybe clothes.\\n\\nAssistant:', \"\\n\\nHuman: What should I say in a toast as best man?\\n\\nAssistant: Toasts are often a great opportunity to express some thoughts or sentiments.

I am interested in trying some Laos dishes. Can you give me a recipe for Jaew Bong?\\n\\nAssistant: Let’s see, that’s what is known in English as a curry of Laotian origin. Curries and stews are prepared by cooking meat and vegetables in a liquid, which can be a sauce. A stew typically includes more vegetables, while a curry has a more distinct sauce flavor.  I have a recipe below for Jaew Bong, which has beef and ginger in the sauce.  To prepare this recipe, I would suggest that you cook the meat first, then add the vegetables and prepare the sauce. You can even get the meat pre-marinated for this dish, but it would still have to be cooked.\\n\\nHuman: The Jaew Bong I am referring is more of a dip. It can be considered a hot pepper dip.\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: I need to lose 5 pounds by next week.

Can you recommend a comedy in his early career?\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: How do I make Japanese fried rice?\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: I am thinking of spring cleaning where should I start?\\n\\nAssistant: Before starting on anything, you should try to categorize everything you plan to clean.  If you know where your items are, it will be much easier to find them.  Perhaps you have a couple of rooms or an office or a closet that you want to clean, or maybe it’s all the same space.\\n\\nHuman: So start by making categories? Then pick the rooms?\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: Which shipping carrier is cheaper for shipping packages?\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: What are the geopolitical reasons why China supports the North Korean dictatorship?\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: George Gershwin seem to be quite prolific.

You might want to check if there are any open source projects you can use, or you might want to buy something like a remote control car or a drone.  They make some pretty inexpensive robots you can program to do things.  You might also want to check out IFTTT if you want to build something more complicated.  This is a service that makes it easier to connect apps and devices together.  You can set up automation scenarios if you want something more advanced.\\n\\nHuman: These are great ideas from my robot army. Thanks\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: should my family and i pray before we eat?\\n\\nAssistant:', \"\\n\\nHuman: How do set goals and keep them?\\n\\nAssistant: Setting goals and following through on them can help you stay on track, as well as give you a sense of accomplishment.  To set goals for yourself, you might choose something you want to accomplish -- such as completing a project, starting a healthy new habit, or traveling to a certain destination.  Then, you might set a deadline for achieving that goal, so you'll know when you're ready to move on to something else.  When you've set a goal for yourself, it can help you stay motivated, and it can help you make progress.  And once you've reached a goal, you might set a new one for yourself, to keep you on track.\\n\\nHuman: I will have to try that.\\n\\nAssistant:\", '\\n\\nHuman: How can you treat the flu?\\n\\nAssistant: If you have the flu, it’s important to rest.  Try to make sure you get plenty of sleep and only do activities that don’t make you too tired.  If you’re very weak, make sure you drink enough fluids.  If you can’t keep anything down, try asking a friend for help in taking medication.\\n\\nHuman: So you need a lot of rest and a lot of fluids?\\n\\nAssistant: Yes, rest and fluids are crucial to fighting the flu.\\n\\nHuman: How long does it usually last?\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: I would like to go to Belgium to see a friend.  What is the capital of Belgium?\\n\\nAssistant: You’ll want to be careful if you’re asking this because Belgium has two capital cities: Brussels and also its legal seat of government, called the Palace of the Nation.  Brussels is located in the country’s French-speaking Flanders region, and is its main political and business center.  The Palace of the Nation, meanwhile, is located in the country’s Dutch-speaking Wallonia region, and has a separate court system.  The two cities are roughly 50 miles apart.\\n\\nHuman: No, there is only one capital.  Brussels is the capital of Belgium.  I just did some research.\\n\\nAssistant: I apologize, I thought you might be asking about “dual sovereignty”:  the rule that the state has two centers of authority.  Please allow me to rephrase:\\n\\nHuman: Two languages are officially spoken in Belgium?  What are they?\\n\\nAssistant:', \"\\n\\nHuman: What are some protein finger foods for babies?\\n\\nAssistant: Those are foods that are made from pure protein, like lean meat and beans.\\n\\nHuman: Okay, my baby can't eat meat yet. He can't chew it.\\n\\nAssistant: Then try purees made from boneless meat and beans.  They will break down in the digestive tract without causing problems for the baby.\\n\\nHuman: I am talking about finger foods.\\n\\nAssistant:\", '\\n\\nHuman: What are the differences between first, second and third degree murder?\\n\\nAssistant: First-degree murder is the most severe form of murder, in which premeditation and deliberation are present. The crime was committed with premeditation—thought about beforehand—and with deliberation—it was carefully planned. Second-degree murder lacks the element of premeditation, but the perpetrator acted with extreme indifference to human life. Third-degree murder is a less severe form of murder, in which there is no premeditation or deliberation.\\n\\nHuman: Can you give me a real world example of first degree murder?\\n\\nAssistant:', \"\\n\\nHuman: What soap opera did Anthony Geary play on?\\n\\nAssistant: As I understand it, he played Luke Spencer, a teacher at a private school, in the soap opera General Hospital from 1976 to 1981.\\n\\nHuman: I don't remember him playing a teacher and I know he played that role much longer then that.\\n\\nAssistant:\"]\n",

The first one I have is called the ‘Jump and Grab’. It is a circular toy that makes a happy purring sound when the cat bounces up and down on it. When the cat catches the toy between their paws, they feel a pull and they can release the toy back into the air. Some cats love this toy and learn to use their paws to catch it without their claws.\\n\\nHuman: Okay, anything else?\\n\\nAssistant: If you use a little cat food with this toy, that can also help encourage cats to use their paws to catch and eat the food.\\n\\nHuman: That might be fun.\\n\\nAssistant:', \"\\n\\nHuman: What's the capital of France?\\n\\nAssistant:\", '\\n\\nHuman: How do you get a scholarship?\\n\\nAssistant: Oh, I don’t know, I’ve never had a scholarship.

It could kill you, or leave you scarred for life. It’s spread by droplets when someone coughs or sneezes, so you can get it from being near someone who is sick. It’s hard to get rid of smallpox, and vaccination became very important. It’s hard to trace the origins of vaccination, but the basic idea has been around since Ancient Egypt. It was developed by Edward Jenner in the late 18th century, after he took note of the fact that people who contracted cowpox rarely contracted smallpox.\\n\\nHuman: What was the death rate for smallpox?\\n\\nAssistant: Of those who got smallpox, around 30% died, and of those who got cowpox, only around 1% died.  This is pretty convincing evidence of the benefits of vaccination!\\n\\nHuman: People got cowpox? How? From the vaccines?\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: Hello, I am trying to find out if aliens are real.

Chromosomes are pieces of DNA, which carry the genetic code. In many organisms, the DNA is found in the form of threadlike structures called chromosomes.\\n\\nHuman: Ohh, interesting. Does that contain someones gender?\\n\\nAssistant: Yes, that’s right.

Why is this?\\n\\nAssistant: Could be genetic. Are they the same size at rest? Have they been developing at the same rate? What are they like when they’re at rest? Are they both always the same size, or does one tend to be bigger than the other?\\n\\nHuman: No, the right one is noticeably bigger all the time.\\n\\nAssistant: What kind of workouts are you doing for them?\\n\\nHuman: Dumbbells curls, pull-ups, the usual. I'm thinking I should only work out my left arm until it catches up to my right in size. Is that a good idea?\\n\\nAssistant:\", \"\\n\\nHuman: I like to explore new art. Can you tell me a bit about Norman Rockwell's artwork pieces?\\n\\nAssistant: Ok, so Norman Rockwell is an artist who made paintings of people. What most people are familiar with are the Saturday Evening Post covers, which Rockwell was commissioned to make, but he was also an incredibly prolific illustrator in other media.\\n\\nHuman: He tends to be in a nostalgic class unto himself. Was he financially successful?\\n\\nAssistant: He was indeed quite wealthy! And a lot of his work ended up in museums.  His pieces are almost all made to look like something from the nineteenth century, and when he died, some of the images became incredibly valuable. I suppose this might be considered nostalgia by some.\\n\\nHuman: His work is featured on the Antiques Roadshow at times.\\n\\nAssistant:\", '\\n\\nHuman: What are the branches of the American military?\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: Can you flush your medicine down the toilet?\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: what are some animals i should show my kid at the zoo?\\n\\nAssistant:', \"\\n\\nHuman: How often should I get a physical?\\n\\nAssistant: Are you a generally healthy person?

            "--- prompt --> step=850, rank=0, ['\\n\\nHuman: What is the main ideology of the \"back to nature\" movement?\\n\\nAssistant: Mainly, it\\'s a rejection of modern industrialized societies. People who are attracted to the back-to-nature movement are attracted to their idea of a less technical, more simple, more moral, or more \"natural\" society.\\n\\nHuman: Are there any public figures in America who have promoted or popularized this ideology?\\n\\nAssistant:', \"\\n\\nHuman: how do I calculate 20% of 1,000?\\n\\nAssistant: I think you mean 20% of 1000, which would be 200?\\n\\nHuman: see. thank you!\\n\\nAssistant: My pleasure. :)\\n\\nHuman: how did you calculate it? What's the formula?\\n\\nAssistant:\", '\\n\\nHuman: Was the U2 a plane or a submarine?\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: Which is better for safety, a van or an SUV?\\n\\nAssistant: Given that SUVs have the potential to be involved in more accidents than van and don’t have the same roomy interior as vans, I would say vans are a better choice for safety.  Do you have more questions about safety?\\n\\nHuman: So why do people choose SUVs?\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: Can you tell me the process of how a publishing company publishes a book?\\n\\nAssistant: Sure!  Publishing companies receive the text of a book from the author or authors.  They then need to consider whether or not to publish it -- which depends on both the quality of the text, and their economic model (how many books they plan to publish this year and how much they think they can sell them for).  If they accept the book, they will then hire editors to review the text and make sure it is of good quality.  The editors make corrections to grammar and spelling, and may also propose changes to the content of the book.  Once all these changes have been made, the text can be set up in a style called “typesetting”.  Finally, the typeset text can be printed in books, and those books can be sold.\\n\\nHuman: Thanks. Can you explain how typesetting is used for the style of the book?\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: how do i get my toddler to stop scratching a mosquito bite\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: I am looking to buy a home, but need to learn about different types of mortgages.  Can you explain a fixed-rate mortgage versus a variable-rate mortgage?\\n\\nAssistant: OK, we can start with the big picture.  A mortgage is a loan from a bank, with terms of a fixed payment every month.  That payment will go down over time as your loan balance decreases.  When the balance is all paid off, you’re no longer making payments on the mortgage.  What you do in between is known as the “term”, and you have different choices of term: 5 years, 10 years, 15 years, etc.\\n\\nHuman: Ok, how does the interest rate factor into a mortgage?\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: How do I teach my kids how to surf?\\n\\nAssistant: There are lots of ways to learn to surf.  It might be best to get them used to the water first, just so they don’t fear the ocean as much, and it’s good to have some basic skills as a reference point before trying to surf in.  I could offer some tips and tricks to help you learn how to surf.  Do you want to give it a try?\\n\\nHuman: Yes, how do I start?\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: How do you treat acne?\\n\\nAssistant: Acne is caused by an excess of oil on the surface of your skin.

Or do you mean that your grass is overgrown and is now in danger of being mowed by your neighbor’s lawn mower?\\n\\nHuman: My grass is dead and I need to replace it.\\n\\nAssistant: Perhaps you mean that your grass is dying and needs to be re-sown.  Or do you mean that your grass is overgrown and is now in danger of being mowed by your neighbor’s lawn mower?\\n\\nHuman: My grass need to be re-swon and I need information on how to do this.\\n\\nAssistant: Perhaps you mean that your grass is dying and needs to be re-sown.

Can you tell me what the movie is about, when it was produced, general information about the movie?\\n\\nAssistant: You’re right that Raiders of the Lost Ark was a popular movie in the 1980’s.  I can provide basic information about the film:\\n\\n-   It was written and directed by Steven Spielberg, and the film was released in 1981.\\n-   The movie starred Harrison Ford, who later played Han Solo in Star Wars.\\n-   The movie was nominated for several Academy Awards, including Best Director, and Best Visual Effects.\\n-   The movie is about archaeologists searching for a hidden religious artifact that gives power to whoever holds it.  It includes a group of Nazi operatives searching for it as well.\\n\\nHuman: That sounds pretty accurate. I believe the lead actress, was also in the show Starman?\\n\\nAssistant: That’s true, Karen Allen played the lead female role.

Can you give me more information about Fields?\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: How do you charge the battery from a cordless power tool?\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: What is the CIA?\\n\\nAssistant: The CIA is the “Central Intelligence Agency”, and it’s a part of the US Government.  It’s the “Central” agency in the sense that it collects and organizes intelligence about the world.  The CIA was created after World War II, in 1947, in order to centralize the collection of information from other US Government agencies.  The CIA also runs the United States’ worldwide spying efforts, and has been instrumental in US counter-terrorism activities.\\n\\nHuman: Is the CIA under the Department of Defense?\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: What does having relationship mean?\\n\\nAssistant: It’s a way of describing a set of connected emotions, actions, and beliefs that exist between two or more people.\\n\\nHuman: What 3 things make a relationship?\\n\\nAssistant: Three things that make a relationship are loving, closeness, and understanding.  You can have a close relationship with someone who doesn’t love you, but then the love isn’t a part of the relationship.\\n\\nHuman: I see, but what makes a good relationship then?\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: How do I learn to be good at making small talk?\\n\\nAssistant: Would you like some tips on the art of small talk?\\n\\nHuman: I would love some tips please!\\n\\nAssistant: How about we go with some simple examples? Let’s say you’re in a company meeting and someone says:\\n\\n“We just received some unfortunate news...”\\n\\nYou could then follow up by saying:\\n\\n“What news is that?...”\\n\\nOr alternatively, you could go:\\n\\n“What do you think about it?...”\\n\\nYou could also follow up with:\\n\\n“How did it make you feel?...”\\n\\nHuman: Okay, I think I can do that.\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: Are there any military that still carry swords today?\\n\\nAssistant: There are certainly some military units that do. They usually use the sword in a ceremonial capacity, to symbolize how their unit represents an army from hundreds of years ago.\\n\\nHuman: Are swords good for anything in modern warfare?\\n\\nAssistant: No, although they might make a good melee weapon if you are very close to the enemy. I guess there are some cultures where soldiers use swords more for practical purposes, but there are also other weapons like guns and knives that are better for fighting at a distance.\\n\\nHuman: I guess they look cool still.\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: what is a good simple recipe for a chicken soup?\\n\\nAssistant: I know a simple and very classic recipe which I can share with you!

Let's look through it together. What are some airlines you see that fly direct between SLC and Portland?\\n\\nAssistant: There are three that pop out at me immediately, United, Delta, and Southwest.  Each airline charges a different amount to fly to Portland from SLC. Here are the fares for each:\\n\\nUnited: $394.60\\nDelta: $308.32\\nSouthwest: $246.68\\n\\nHuman: What about cheaper airlines like Frontier that have multiple stops and don't fly direct?\\n\\nAssistant:\", '\\n\\nHuman: I\\'m travelling abroad and need to learn to ask for a doctor in different languages.

One of the most controversial and challenging issues was the Iran hostage crisis, which began when militants stormed the U.S. embassy in Tehran and took American hostages in 1979. Carter took a very strong stance on the hostage crisis and refused to give into the demands of the hostage takers. This stance damaged Carter’s popularity and his ability to get other major pieces of legislation passed. Another major foreign policy challenge for Carter was his handling of the relationship with the Soviet Union. He attempted to improve relations with the Soviets, but the two nations remained far apart. Carter also had to deal with an ongoing conflict in Afghanistan, a Soviet invasion of Afghanistan that he strongly opposed, and the possibility of a nuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union.\\n\\nHuman: how did he handle these challenges\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: What foods can I eat to improve my heart health?\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: When was the modern fishing reel invented?\\n\\nAssistant:', \"\\n\\nHuman: I'm thinking about online dating, do you think it's a good idea?\\n\\nAssistant:\", '\\n\\nHuman: I drink coffee everyday.  I want to know more about coffee.  How did coffee come to the United States?\\n\\nAssistant: Coffee first came to the United States in the late 1700s.  The climate and soil in America were very favorable for growing coffee.  A major early center for coffee growing and roasting was New Orleans.  In the early 1800s, coffee came to New York City, and that area has become the primary coffee-growing region in the United States.  You may have heard of New York City coffee roaster Dean & DeLuca, a popular chain in Manhattan.\\n\\nHuman: Which country produces the most coffee in the world?\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: How do I dress my baby in a gender neutral manner?\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: What is the difference between organic foods and nonorganic foods?\\n\\nAssistant:', \"\\n\\nHuman: Which common household chemical, is best for cleaning overall?\\n\\nAssistant: Well, bleach, specifically the kind that can be purchased at your grocery store, is definitely among the best.   You can use it to clean pretty much any kind of surface.  However, it can be dangerous and make you feel sick or nauseated, which is why people usually only use it when it's needed, which is when the surface has gotten grime or food on it and needs a thorough clean.\\n\\nHuman: I tend to agree with you, but diluting it is best.

To design a roof truss, you’ll need to determine the size and shape of the structure, as well as the materials that will be used.  You should also ensure that the truss is strong and sturdy, as it will bear the weight of the roof.  Overall, designing a roof truss involves determining the structural requirements of the garage, then creating a truss that meets those requirements.\\n\\nHuman: Thanks. What are some common roof truss designs?\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: i just got a new car. what are some of things that i can do to make sure that i have it as long as possible?\\n\\nAssistant: There are several things you can do to care for your car, which will help it run reliably for many years.  The most important things to focus on are keeping your car’s tires properly inflated, and having regular tune-ups to replace or repair worn-out parts.  You should also check your car’s oil regularly and always maintain it according to your owner’s manual.  And if you do drive your car frequently, you can also increase its longevity by keeping it well-maintained and serviced.\\n\\nHuman: thats sounds easy enough. are there sounds or signs that i should keep an eye out for when riding in the car? like do different parts make different sounds or exhibit signs before its too late\\n\\nAssistant:', \"\\n\\nHuman: I'm camping in the backcountry and have to go to the bathroom, but I don't have any toilet paper.

Can you find them for me?\\n\\nAssistant:\", '\\n\\nHuman: What was the Battle of the Bulge in World War II?\\n\\nAssistant: The Battle of the Bulge was a surprise German offensive, begun on 16 December 1944, in the Ardennes Forest, when Allied lines were thought to be much farther south. After overrunning American lines, the German force attacked through Belgium, almost reaching Antwerp, and splitting the American forces. A counter-offensive was ordered by the American Commander, General Omar Bradley. The counter-offensive, known as the Battle of the Bulge, began on 16 January 1945. More than 90,000 Germans were killed or wounded in the battle.\\n\\nHuman: Who was the German general in this battle?\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: I like to host guests at my home from time to time, and I am gathering  recipes of different dishes and drinks to keep things interesting.

Is he close to other relatives or not?\\n\\nHuman: mild mannered, and close.\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: How do veterans deal with PTSD?\\n\\nAssistant: Well, PTSD is an acronym that stands for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, and is a serious mental health condition that some people experience when they have been through a traumatic event.  This could be experiencing something like a serious car accident, or it could also be serving in the military.  Common symptoms of PTSD are difficulty sleeping, flashbacks, anxiety and agitation, and depression, and often patients need medical or psychological treatment to treat these symptoms.\\n\\nHuman: It sounds terrible.\\n\\nAssistant:', \"\\n\\nHuman: I'm going on a vacation.

They’re real to the extent that the people who appear in them are real people. They may act or some of them may be scripted, but I think most of it is actually authentic.

            "--- prompt --> step=925, rank=0, ['\\n\\nHuman: Are Romani people in Europe citizens of any European countries?\\n\\nAssistant: Most Romani people in Europe are citizens of some European country, and are considered ethnic minorities there. In some cases, Romani people are not able to legally reside in some countries where they were forcibly expelled. For example, the Gypsies of Croatia, Roma of Lithuania, the Romani of Slovenia, and many Roma communities in the former Yugoslavia have been denied formal residency status for decades.\\n\\nHuman: Are those people stateless then?\\n\\nAssistant: It’s hard to say, since there’s no international framework of statelessness that applies to all people and situations. What’s true is that in some of the countries where they’re not able to legally reside, these Romani people are classified as “undesirable” or “socially dangerous” and as such, their movements and residence are closely monitored. In some countries, these Romani people are actually explicitly referred to as “stateless”.\\n\\nHuman: Where did they come from?  Perhaps they should return to their original country so that they will not become stateless.\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: How do you make dill pickles?\\n\\nAssistant: Well first we take a cucumber and slice it up. Then we put the slices in a jar with a bunch of spices and vinegar and salt. Then we wait, until the cucumbers have transformed into pickles!\\n\\nHuman: How long will that take?\\n\\nAssistant: Theoretically, anything could happen. But in general, I’d say a few weeks, since that’s the science of fermentation. It really depends on the saltiness and acidity of the pickling liquid, and also the temperature.\\n\\nHuman: Thanks!\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: What can I do to protect my tablet from viruses?\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: How do you stay awake when you feel tired?\\n\\nAssistant: I’m not really sure, but if it helps, I just like to try to think about a task I’m going to complete when I get to bed, like brushing my teeth.  If I have a positive plan to carry out when I get to bed, I find it easier to keep my eyes open.\\n\\nHuman: So maybe brush my teeth?\\n\\nAssistant: A good one to use while you are tired and trying to avoid sleeping.\\n\\nHuman: Any other ideas?\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: Why are there different time zones in the world?\\n\\nAssistant:', \"\\n\\nHuman: Do you need to keep the gas tank full in the winter?\\n\\nAssistant: I can tell you some facts about how gas in your car works, and you can decide for yourself if you need to keep the gas tank full in the winter.  It’s easy for gas to form in your tank during the winter, even when it’s empty.  That’s because the gas is stored in a porous material, and this can trap moisture in the tank.  This can lead to gelling in your fuel system, and this is definitely a big problem.\\n\\nHuman: I don't think I want gel in my gas tank.\\n\\nAssistant:\", '\\n\\nHuman: What are some things that can be added to a Christmas tree?\\n\\nAssistant: Here are a few common additions to a Christmas tree:\\n\\n\\n-   Ornaments\\n-   Lights\\n-   Candy canes\\n-   Snowflakes\\n-   Poinsettias\\n-   Pinecones\\n-   Bows\\n-   Garland\\n\\nHuman: I have lights and ornaments but how do I incorporate poinsettias or pinecones?\\n\\nAssistant:', \"\\n\\nHuman: Do kids need vaccine's to go to school?\\n\\nAssistant: Vaccines are generally beneficial for people’s health, and we recommend people get them.

Would you happen to have a recipe for making Italian dressing?\\n\\nAssistant: I do! I can help you make it.  Why don’t we start by gathering the ingredients you’ll need.\\n\\nHuman: Okay, what are the ingredients?\\n\\nAssistant: You’ll need some egg yolks, a little bit of lemon juice, a pinch of salt, olive oil, and garlic.\\n\\nHuman: Hm, not sure that's right. I don't think egg yolks go in it.\\n\\nAssistant: No?  Oh, I guess that means I’m doing it wrong!  Let me check something.

Or is this one of those riddles where you figure out the answer?\\n\\nHuman: Ones that have morals at the end.\\n\\nAssistant: Can you be more specific?  Are we talking about fables that are maybe meant to tell us something about the world?  Or stories with other lessons?\\n\\nHuman: Ones with lessons.\\n\\nAssistant: Like fables with morals?\\n\\nHuman: yes\\n\\nAssistant: How about the “Starving Children” fable?  Or “The Lazy Ants”?\\n\\nHuman: The starving children one is just bad for kids.\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: Are artificial sweeteners better or worse than sugar itself?\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: Can you help me learn a bit about natural selection?\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: I need to rewire a lamp.\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: Who are major cell phone carriers?\\n\\nAssistant: There are four major ones in the US: AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon, and Sprint.\\n\\nHuman: Which one is the largest carrier?\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: How does smoking cause cancer?\\n\\nAssistant: Smoking causes cancer because it damages the lungs. The lungs are a filter for your body, and when they become damaged, they cannot remove harmful substances from the bloodstream as effectively as healthy lungs would. When you smoke, you inhale harmful substances, such as carcinogens, which damage the cells in your lungs. Over time, these carcinogens increase your risk for lung cancer and other respiratory diseases.\\n\\nHuman: how long does it take for smoking to cause cancer\\n\\nAssistant:', \"\\n\\nHuman: Hi, I've noticed I become very itchy over the winter months. What can I do to reduce that?\\n\\nAssistant: Alright, I can tell you about a couple of things you might do to reduce itchiness that don’t involve scratching.\\n\\nHuman: Okay, let's hear them.\\n\\nAssistant:\", '\\n\\nHuman: Do chimps swim?\\n\\nAssistant: They might play in the water, but they certainly don’t swim on purpose.

Also, when you’re in Indonesia, I suggest you go to a few of the islands nearby, including Sumba and Sumatra.\\n\\nHuman: Kuala Lumpur is in Malaysia\\n\\nAssistant: I stand corrected, it looks like “Kuala Lumpur” is a city in Malaysia, which I can also list for you.  Do you want to know more cities to visit in Malaysia?\\n\\nHuman: No, only Indonesia.\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: Who were the stars of The Kardashians show?\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: Are expensive jackets worth the cost?\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: What can I do for Lunar new year?\\n\\nAssistant: Lunar new year is a special holiday which takes place at the beginning of each new lunar year, and it celebrates the lunar new year with visits to family, friends, and neighbors, and to exchange gifts.

The speed of sound depends on temperature, humidity, barometric pressure, and many other conditions, but usually it’s about 1,200 miles per hour (i.e. 1,500 kilometers per hour).  So to go “supersonic” means you’re moving faster than that.\\n\\nHuman: Can objects like planes or bullets travel faster than the speed of sound? Is that what Mach 1 mean?\\n\\nAssistant: Right.  The speed of sound is kind of a fundamental limit in physics, but there are also “sonic booms”, which are a loud noise made when an object breaks the sound barrier.

Additionally, pornography may contribute to an increase in sexual objectification, especially of women, and some people believe that porn is linked to an increase in sexual aggression and violence.\\n\\nHuman: What do you think is the connection between porn and objectification?\\n\\nAssistant: Many researchers have argued that porn can contribute to a culture in which people view women and men as sex objects rather than whole people, and can reduce feelings of empathy and respect for others. Other studies have found that frequent exposure to porn is linked to a reduced desire to form romantic relationships and a decrease in interest in intimacy, both of which can be harmful for personal relationships.\\n\\nHuman: That makes sense, but why would porn contribute to objectification?\\n\\nAssistant:']\n",

            "--- prompt --> step=975, rank=0, [\"\\n\\nHuman: I'd love to know more about the sculpture of The Thinker, by Rodin. What do you know?\\n\\nAssistant: Well, The Thinker is a famous sculpture by Auguste Rodin that was created in 1880. He was a French sculptor who created many pieces that are all very famous, such as The Kiss, The Burghers of Calais, and The Gates of Hell.\\n\\nHuman: The Kiss sounds vaguely familiar too.\\n\\nAssistant:\", '\\n\\nHuman: What is the best brand of luggage to buy?\\n\\nAssistant: To help me give you a quality answer to this question, I first need you to clarify that for you “best” means something more specific than just “good”.  There are many brands of luggage that are high-quality and attractive, but some brands are better than others.  So for me to give you a helpful answer, can you clarify exactly what aspect of “best” you’re interested in?\\n\\nHuman: I am looking for the best in terms of quality\\n\\nAssistant: Thank you for being more specific.  If you’re interested in the highest quality bags that also happen to be highly durable, practical, and pleasing to look at, I’d recommend the Samsonite suitcases.  Some other manufacturers make very high-quality bags, but as I understand the market, most people prefer their bags to be sleeker and more streamlined, which is what makes the Samsonite suitcases so good.\\n\\nHuman: What are some other brands that you can recommend?\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: What is the winter solstice?\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: What is the best time of the year to plant Sun Flowers in my garden?\\n\\nAssistant: Since this will likely depend on climate and soil, I’d recommend speaking to a gardener or agricultural specialist who could answer your question.\\n\\nHuman: I would be planting this flowers in Maryland.\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: How does a chiropractor help you?\\n\\nAssistant: Many people have low back pain, and a chiropractor can help by adjusting the spine to treat it.  That is, a chiropractor will adjust the spine to adjust the spine.  He or she can adjust the back to loosen tight muscles and ligaments, and realign the vertebrae to treat common misalignments that are behind low back pain.  Chiropractors are trained in helping many people get over back pain.  Does that help?\\n\\nHuman: Do it have to been done a lot?\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: How do I get better at word searches?\\n\\nAssistant:', \"\\n\\nHuman: I've read that PBS is a publicly funded broadcast station. Are there any limitations put on PBS due to public funds?\\n\\nAssistant:\", \"\\n\\nHuman: I'm thinking about watching a movie tonight. Can you list one or two movies with Halle Berry in them?\\n\\nAssistant:\", '\\n\\nHuman: How do you get the sink to stop dripping?\\n\\nAssistant: You need to turn off the water at the valve under the sink.  You should also check the seal of the sink.  If you have a leak from the seal, you might need to replace it, or if the sink is old you might need to replace the entire unit.\\n\\nHuman: How do you turn off the water?\\n\\nAssistant: You need to open the valve under the sink.  This is a common problem, you might need to jiggle the handle a little to get the valve to turn.\\n\\nHuman: Ok I will try that.\\n\\nAssistant:', \"\\n\\nHuman: Why does my exhaust pipe smell so bad?\\n\\nAssistant: The smell could come from the pipes or the engine. Do you smell the exhaust while the engine is running or while it’s off?  What condition is the exhaust system in?  Is it cracked?  Is the plastic seal broken?\\n\\nHuman: I don't see any cracks but maybe I'll have to check again.\\n\\nAssistant: I'd recommend having a look at the pipes while the engine is running, and ask your mechanic if there are any visible signs of damage to the pipes.\\n\\nHuman: What else could it be?\\n\\nAssistant: It could be any number of other things, depending on how recently you've taken your car in to have the exhaust system checked.  If it’s just one specific place where the exhaust is really bad, then that might be a seal that's broken.  In my experience, though, it's also possible that this smell is just due to general wear and tear on the system.  And that's a problem with the pipes that can really only be fixed by replacing them.\\n\\nHuman: Okay, I guess I'll bring it to a mechanic.\\n\\nAssistant:\", '\\n\\nHuman: What can I use to slick down my hair?\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: How do you take care of a salamandar?\\n\\nAssistant: Well, most people keep them in a ceramic or glass aquarium, although some people use a terrarium.  You can feed them earthworms, shrimp, or some other meaty seafood.  Make sure the water temperature is between 75 and 80 degrees, and the salamanders need some time in the sun each day.  They need a moist substrate to crawl around on, and also some hiding spots.  If you notice they’re looking stressed, provide a bit of hiding place and make sure their water is still nice and moist.\\n\\nHuman: What do salamanders eat?\\n\\nAssistant: They usually eat a variety of meaty seafood like earthworms, shrimp, or bits of fish, or they might eat some fruit or vegetables.  They also need some vegetables to help them digest their food, like leafy greens or broccoli.  Try to offer a variety of things for them to eat.  They also like the heat, so they need a warm place to crawl around in, and also they need the heat to help them digest their food.\\n\\nHuman: Thanks for the help.\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: Do Hawaiian really wear bras made from coconut shells?\\n\\nAssistant: Yes, Hawaiian women do indeed wear bras made from coconut shells.  The shells are harvested from mature coconuts, and then carefully cleaned, carved, and stitched together to create a smooth, supportive bra.  Some women prefer them to regular bras because they have a natural, tropical feel to them.\\n\\nHuman: I guess but they look painful\\n\\nAssistant:', \"\\n\\nHuman: I'd like to help a friend who's moving soon. Do you have any thoughtful pointers on how to help?\\n\\nAssistant: I'm happy to listen and help with ideas, and perhaps also refer you to local resources or places to read more.  One thing you might do is ask if they need help packing.\\n\\nHuman: That's good.  Maybe help driving the big truck when they do move too.\\n\\nAssistant:\", '\\n\\nHuman: Does working night shift affect health?\\n\\nAssistant: Yes, it can have negative effects on your sleep patterns and also on your hormone regulation.\\n\\nHuman: So it can be bad for your sleep and your hormones?\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: How are bills passed in the United States?\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: What are some good side dishes for beef roast?\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: What are some good raspberry pie recipes?\\n\\nAssistant: Humans love raspberry pie.  It’s sweet and juicy, and makes a good dessert.\\n\\nHuman: Do you have any recipe suggestions?\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: Should my dog go to dog school?\\n\\nAssistant: Sure, that sounds like a great idea! I think dogs benefit a lot from being around other dogs in a play setting.  So is there a particular type of dog school you’re thinking about?\\n\\nHuman: I mean one for training.\\n\\nAssistant: Ah, I see.  That could be a really positive thing for your dog to go through, since you’ll be able to shape its behavior in more detailed and intentional ways than just by giving it rewards and punishments based on its current behavior.  I actually think this is a great idea!  What kind of behavior are you hoping to change?\\n\\nHuman: Could even a regular house dog benefit?\\n\\nAssistant: Yes, many dogs can benefit from this kind of training.  If you are concerned about particular behaviors your dog might have, you could even pick a training class based on the particular behaviors you want to work on.  For example, you could sign up for a class about social skills for shy dogs, a class about separation anxiety, or a class on leash training.\\n\\nHuman: Okay and can they learn tricks there?\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: What is Google Hangouts?\\n\\nAssistant:', \"\\n\\nHuman: What's the best way to stay protected, during a hail storm?\\n\\nAssistant: Are you in the path of a hail storm? Is there a tornado warning in effect? Are you worried about severe thunderstorms?\\n\\nHuman: It seems to be just a short storm, but I was curious as to how to stay protected from the falling ice.\\n\\nAssistant:\", '\\n\\nHuman: How can I make a pillow out of a shirt?\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: Should you do good deeds?\\n\\nAssistant: Good deeds can be rewarding, and might give a positive impression on other people. They can also help you achieve some personal goals or make it easier for you to do the things you care about.  They can also improve your mental state, and make it easier for you to enjoy your life, do the things you want, and sleep at night.\\n\\nHuman: So it can definitely be a good thing.\\n\\nAssistant:', \"\\n\\nHuman: How do you keep from getting covid?\\n\\nAssistant: By staying away from others and trying to keep myself healthy by eating good, nutritious foods, exercising regularly, getting plenty of sleep, and washing my hands frequently.\\n\\nHuman: I already wash my hands. I try to stay away from others best I can. Is there anything else I can do?\\n\\nAssistant: I would recommend taking extra measures. There are some precautions that can make a huge difference, like wearing a mask when you go out, maintaining 6 feet of distance from others, staying away from indoor places where lots of people congregate like big buildings, theaters, shopping malls, etc. I’d also recommend taking the time to educate yourself about the virus and the best practices to protect yourself.\\n\\nHuman: Yes I try to wear a mask. Others have not been wearing one lately but I still am. I try to stay away from others if I can. I don't go out much except where I have to, such as work.\\n\\nAssistant:\"]\n",

Explorer is more popular.\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: How do air conditioners work\\n\\nAssistant: An air conditioner is a machine that regulates the temperature of the surrounding air.  A traditional air conditioner contains three main parts: the condenser, the compressor, and the evaporator.  \\n\\nThe compressor, which sits outside your home or office, pumps the air inside your home or office through the condenser.  In the condenser, the air gets warmer, causing the water in it to vaporize.  The vaporized water goes to the evaporator, where it is cooled and turned back into a liquid.  Finally, the liquid is returned to the compressor to be reheated and pumped back into your home or office.\\n\\nThe overall process cools the air that you breathe by removing the heat from it, so that it does not reach the temperature of the surrounding air.\\n\\nHuman: Super interesting\\n\\nAssistant: Cool, any other questions I can answer?\\n\\nHuman: No that will be all thanks\\n\\nAssistant:', \"\\n\\nHuman: What is Dolly Parton's most famous song?\\n\\nAssistant:\", '\\n\\nHuman: How can I press a flower?\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: Why are people that have bipolar disorder so unpredictable and mean?\\n\\nAssistant: People who have bipolar disorder often have severe mood swings between depression and mania.  In their manic phase, they can be excessively euphoric and energetic, and they also might make impulsive decisions and behave inappropriately, such as buying sprees, or taking unnecessary risks.  Meanwhile, during their depressive phase, they often feel hopeless and suicidal, and also may be irritable and act out inappropriately, such as lashing out at others, or getting into arguments.\\n\\nHuman: So they go be either way and it can swing very quickly?\\n\\nAssistant: Yes, they might go from being very manic and elated to being severely depressed in a short amount of time.  This happens rapidly and unpredictably, and can also sometimes happen the other way.  Similarly, they might feel completely hopeless and suicidal during their depressive phases, but also act out in an inappropriate way, such as getting into arguments, or making impulsive decisions, like buying things they don’t need.  So they might have both very emotional cycles, but also very extreme cycles.\\n\\nHuman: That sounds awful.\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: What does assault on the sacred mean?\\n\\nAssistant: Assault on the sacred can mean a number of things, depending on the specific context. In some contexts, it means intentional harm to something considered sacred. This can include physical harm to a place or object considered sacred, or psychological abuse of individuals or groups that are considered sacred.\\n\\nHuman: Is the U.S. constitution a sacred document?\\n\\nAssistant: Yes, the U.S. Constitution is considered a sacred document by many people, including myself. Many people hold it in very high esteem and believe it sets a high moral standard for the country. It is also the law of the land, and the legitimacy of the government itself depends on the Constitution. In some ways, the Constitution is also a reflection of the values of the country.\\n\\nHuman: Is the bill of rights a sacred document?\\n\\nAssistant: The bill of rights is considered a sacred document by many people, and also serves as the constitutional framework for many rights.\\n\\nHuman: Civil rights documents considered sacred?\\n\\nAssistant:', \"\\n\\nHuman: I have a pendant, what is something I can use to attach it to my neck?\\n\\nAssistant: You can find silver or gold chain with small links to attach to the pendant.  Or you can use a small safety pin to attach it to your shirt.  Or you can use a cord that comes with the pendant to attach it to your necklace.  Or you can glue it to the back of a pendant to hang from a necklace.\\n\\nHuman: What kind of cord? It doesn't have one.\\n\\nAssistant:\", '\\n\\nHuman: Is it true that ostriches bury their head in the sand?\\n\\nAssistant: Yes, ostriches are known to bury their head in the sand in order to protect themselves from predators. This behavior is considered a defense mechanism.\\n\\nHuman: Is it effective?\\n\\nAssistant: While the behavior may initially protect the ostrich from predators, this strategy isn’t very effective in the long term. In order for an ostrich to survive, it must be able to see what’s happening around it. By burying its head in the sand, an ostrich is completely vulnerable to predators.\\n\\nHuman: What are the predators?\\n\\nAssistant: The main predators of ostriches are large cats, such as lions, cheetahs, and leopards, and birds of prey. Some smaller snakes and reptiles are also known to prey on ostriches.\\n\\nHuman: What about the eggs?\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: Is the price of Gold is expected to go up?\\n\\nAssistant: Is what price expected to go up?\\n\\nHuman: The price of gold\\n\\nAssistant:', \"\\n\\nHuman: What's the best way to update the driver for a Nvidia brand graphics card?\\n\\nAssistant: You can visit www.nvidia.com for information about new drivers, or use a tool like the Windows Update service.\\n\\nHuman: That method could work and I could find relevant information on Nvidia's website. One common way to update the driver for Nvidia graphics cards is the use the Nvidia Experience application. You have to install it first and then just use the express installation to install new driver. You can even set everything up so it's fully automated without requiring user input.\\n\\nAssistant:\", '\\n\\nHuman: What did apes evolve from?\\n\\nAssistant:', \"\\n\\nHuman: Who invented the telephone?\\n\\nAssistant: You may have heard this story before, but the modern telephone was invented by Alexander Graham Bell in the late 1800s.  Before that, you had to stand up and yell loudly if you wanted to talk to someone far away.  Alexander Graham Bell wanted to improve on this old and inconvenient technology.  He thought that if you could hear a sound in one room, you should be able to hear it in a distant room through a wire, which you could use like a telephone.  This is how he ended up inventing the telephone.  He also wrote down a patent for it, which the U.S. Patent Office granted.\\n\\nHuman: This is only partially the correct answer. Firstly, people used telegraphs or letters to correspond long-distance prior to the invention of the telephone. It's nonsense to suggest they just shouted at each other. Secondly, Alexander Graham Bell is often credited with being the inventor of the telephone since he was awarded the first successful patent. However, there were many other inventors such as Elisha Gray and Antonio Meucci who also developed a talking telegraph.\\n\\nAssistant:\", \"\\n\\nHuman: I'm looking for good companies to do online gig work.

You should also avoid giving them too many cough syrups, since these are often not safe for young children. If their cough is particularly bad, it may be helpful to give them an over-the-counter cough suppressant, which can help make breathing easier. If their cough is dry, it may also be helpful to use a humidifier to help loosen their cough and bring up phlegm.\\n\\nHuman: What kinds of fluids should I give my toddler?\\n\\nAssistant: When treating a toddler’s cough, it’s important to give them plenty of fluids, especially water or watered-down fruit juice. These fluids will help keep them hydrated, and also soothe their sore throat. You can also offer them steam from a hot shower or a humidifier, which can help loosen phlegm and make breathing easier. Warm soup is also a good choice, since it’s easy to digest and may help soothe a sore throat.\\n\\nHuman: Will Gatorade work?\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: Can you tell me the characteristics seen in modern architecture?\\n\\nAssistant: OK, modern architecture tends to be glass, metal and concrete, or stone-veneered or reinforced concrete, and is often characterized by modern design and engineering, reflecting the goals of the architect and builder.  It is sometimes modern because of the ways it serves modern life, which now tends to be more sedentary and less formal in setting, compared to the more formal and often monumental architecture from the past.\\n\\nHuman: Okay and what are the shapes most modern houses are constructed as?\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: What are some desserts I could make for Halloween?\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: What are ways that I can practice being open minded?\\n\\nAssistant: Being open minded means being willing to entertain new ideas.

Well perhaps if you think about it, you’ve had many times in the past when you’ve found that having a flexible view of the world really helps you get your work done.\\n\\nHuman: Right. So what are ways in which I can practice being open minded?\\n\\nAssistant:', \"\\n\\nHuman: I want to climb a mountain.

Paella parties are typically organized at a community center, and people bring their own special, hand-made recipes to the party.  There’s always lots of good food, singing and dancing.\\n\\nHuman: Can you give me a recipe for making paella at home?\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: What is kickstarter?\\n\\nAssistant: Kickstarter is a site where people post projects they want to do, and people are able to pledge small amounts of money to make the projects happen.

They’re doing this because:\\n\\nThe cost of launching satellites into space has decreased significantly.\\n\\nThe competition between companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin means that all these companies will compete for a greater share of the market, so all will want to build more rockets.\\n\\nHuman: Does Russia still have cheaper rocket launches?\\n\\nAssistant:', \"\\n\\nHuman: I'm trying to teach my son how to ride a 2 wheel bike.\\n\\nAssistant: Are you using a training wheel?\\n\\nHuman: I want to get rid of the training wheels.\\n\\nAssistant: Why?\\n\\nHuman: Because I want him to ride without the training wheels.\\n\\nAssistant: Why do you want that?\\n\\nHuman: Because he's growing up and needs to learn.\\n\\nAssistant:\", '\\n\\nHuman: How do I create a chat app?\\n\\nAssistant: Are you thinking of a chat application that would run within a web browser, or something separate?\\n\\nHuman: Web browser please\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: It is time to decorate for Christmas. How can I make my home look like a winter wonderland?\\n\\nAssistant: It sounds like you want a bit of festive decoration to go with your home. What sort of home do you have?\\n\\nHuman: It is a small, traditional style home\\n\\nAssistant: Do you prefer Christmas trees, or maybe a wreath? Or do you have any other special ideas?\\n\\nHuman: I like both trees and wreaths. What decorations should I put in the yard?\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: Why are winter days shorter than summer days?\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: How do you get cast as an extra on a movie?\\n\\nAssistant: For movie acting, there’s an audition process, and you’ll need to have some professional photos and a resumé.  There’s no guarantees, but it helps to have some experience acting and get some professional training.\\n\\nHuman: How do you find the auditions?\\n\\nAssistant: Movie auditions tend to be posted online, so you can use search engines to find them.  Since the past few years, many have been held at locations that have been open to the public and you’ll often be able to just attend them if you have the time, but in the past there were often local auditions that are only open to those who know someone who’s involved in the production.\\n\\nHuman: Thank you\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: How do I do a backbend?\\n\\nAssistant: That is a good question.

Is that actually true?\\n\\nAssistant:\", '\\n\\nHuman: What is a second mortgage?\\n\\nAssistant: A second mortgage is a loan that’s taken out on a house or property.  It can be used as part of a strategy to get more financing for a property.  It’s possible to get a second mortgage in order to purchase a house, but it can also be useful to refinance the existing mortgage to take advantage of a better rate or better terms.  In general, it can be risky to take out a second mortgage on your house.\\n\\nHuman: Why is it risky?\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: What two radio stations do you listen to in the car the most?\\n\\nAssistant: I listen to two radio stations the most in the car:  91.7 KKLQ and 94.5 KDAY.  91.7 KKLQ has better classic rock and alternative music, while 94.5 KDAY has better pop and hip-hop.  I also like 107.7 KVPT for their music selection, but they only come on in the mornings.\\n\\nHuman: but im in ga\\n\\nAssistant: Oh, in Georgia, the two stations that come to mind are 92.9 The GA Eagle and 94.9 The Buzz.  The GA Eagle has a variety of music, but the Buzz focuses on pop music.\\n\\nHuman: what about hip hop\\n\\nAssistant: Try 107.7 KVPT.\\n\\nHuman: ok thanks\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: How does home insurance work?\\n\\nAssistant: Sure, what would you like to know?\\n\\nHuman: Do insurance companies want to have less claims so they keep more money?\\n\\nAssistant: That’s actually not the best approach to this issue.  I have access to public data about insurance companies’ business models, and this seems like a very common question.  There are also many business models that allow an insurance company to profitably write a higher amount of coverage and not lose money.  So insurance companies are not necessarily trying to keep more money, they are just trying to have profitable businesses.\\n\\nHuman: Can you tell me what a home insurance business model looks like?\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: I have allergies.

Can you clarify more?  I know of the city of La Linea de la Concepción, which is on the border with Portugal.  How about that?\\n\\nHuman: Yes,  La Linea de la Concepción is the full name, but I thought it was near Gibraltar....?\\n\\nAssistant: I see, you are thinking of Gibraltar and La Linea, the beach area?

Can you tell me more about what you're hoping to find out?\\n\\nHuman: Is there anything to do there?\\n\\nAssistant:\", '\\n\\nHuman: what can i do with fresh lemons?\\n\\nAssistant:', \"\\n\\nHuman: Why do people microchip their pets?\\n\\nAssistant: People microchip their pets for many different reasons. The primary reasons include identification, location, and medical information. Pets often get lost, and microchipping allows you to find them easily. Microchipping also allows you to track the whereabouts of your pet. In the event of an emergency, having the microchip information makes it easy for authorities to find your pet. In addition, some owners microchip their pets for their own peace of mind, knowing that their pet can be located easily in case of an emergency.\\n\\nHuman: But I've seen Missing Animal posters up for microchipped animals. Do microchips allow reliable tracking, or is it like cell phone reception and depending on where the animal is, it drops out of tracking?\\n\\nAssistant:\", '\\n\\nHuman: How do green screens work?\\n\\nAssistant: Green screens are a popular visual effect in film and television.  A green screen background will be set up in a studio or a shoot location, and a person or object will be recorded on top of it.  The image of the person or object will be imported into a computer software program, such as Adobe After Effects, and a field of pixels will be selected from the footage.  The selected pixels will be replaced with a background image or color.  The resulting image will then be imported back into the video and combined with the background image.\\n\\nHuman: When were they first used?\\n\\nAssistant: Green screens were popularized in TV shows in the 1970s and 1980s, but their use actually dates back to the 1950s.  They’ve also been used in feature films since the 1960s.\\n\\nHuman: What TV shows use green screens?\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: I want to know the history of Broadway theatre.  Can you help me?\\n\\nAssistant: I think you might mean something a bit different by “Broadway theatre”.  Maybe you’re trying to refer to something related to West 44th street and the famous “Great White Way”, which has a long history as a place for commercial theatre?\\n\\nHuman: I am not sure because I have never heard the famous “Great White Way”.  Where is Broadway located?\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: I want to build muscle on my arms and upper body, what kind of meals should I be eating to bulk up?\\n\\nAssistant: I’m glad you’re trying to get stronger, but remember that food is just fuel for your body. The foods you choose to eat don’t change the structure of your body.\\n\\nHuman: I do not think food alone will make a change but would like some help in finding foods that will boost the results from body building.\\n\\nAssistant: It sounds like you’re looking for “tips and tricks” to get stronger.\\n\\nHuman: Yes I am going to the gym and working out but am not putting on much muscle. I need meal plans to help my get better results.\\n\\nAssistant:', \"\\n\\nHuman: I like to host guests at my home from time to time, and I am gathering  recipes of different dishes and drinks to keep things interesting. I am interested in trying some  Yemini dishes. Can you give me a recipe for Aseeda?\\n\\nAssistant: Sure, that should be easy. I could even provide you with some additional recipes. What’s your diet like?\\n\\nHuman: I think I eat fairly healthy.\\n\\nAssistant: Great. In that case, here is a lovely Aseeda recipe, which includes brown rice, lentils, parsley, chicken, and tomatoes, among other ingredients.\\n\\nHuman: I  don't that is correct.  Aseeda or asida is a moist, pasty dough consisting of flour, water, yogurt, salt and sunflower oil that is then filled with a rich chicken broth on top, consisting of cooked chicken, onions, water, salt, pepper, garlic, cardamoms, cumin and cilantro.\\n\\nAssistant:\", '\\n\\nHuman: Is gold magnetic at all?\\n\\nAssistant:', '\\n\\nHuman: What should a birthing partner have?\\n\\nAssistant: A plan of action, and the practical skills to implement it.

In addition, here’s a list of the birthing partner’s supplies:\\n\\nDisposable underwear.\\nA towel, preferably large.\\nDisposable sheets or a disposable blanket.\\nOver-the-counter pain relievers and other birth-related supplies.\\nAn idea of how long the mother-to-be’s labor may last.\\n\\nHuman: Disposable underwear for the partner?\\n\\nAssistant:', \"\\n\\nHuman: I'm trying to learn how to dance better, can you recommend any dance moves that are easy for a beginner?\\n\\nAssistant: I can give you some general advice for being a better dancer. If you want to add a new dance move to your dance routine, you can just keep practicing the ones you already know, to improve. For example, dancing has lots of tiny little details that can be difficult to notice for yourself, but become easier to see if you watch someone else dancing. Try looking at dancers on YouTube or other videos, and experiment to figure out which parts of their dance are easier or harder than what you are currently doing. You might even find that watching videos makes your dance routine look smoother!\\n\\nHuman: Is there a dance that I could easily learn?\\n\\nAssistant: Yes, a lot of dances are very straightforward. There are many moves that involve movements only of the arms and the head, and just a few moves of the legs, so that's a good starting place.  Let me show you a simple dance that's a little bit harder than just moving your arms and head:\\n\\nHuman: What dance are you going to show me?\\n\\nAssistant:\"]\n",

Your doctor may also offer you a different vaccine, like the Pfizer one, instead.\\n\\nHuman: I mean the more common side effects like fatigue, soreness, and dizziness.\\n\\nAssistant: Ah, I’m sorry.  That is a good question.  If you have received the vaccine already, you may find you have lingering side effects, but they should improve over time.\\n\\nHuman: Well I was advised to stay hydrated and get plenty of rest but you're correct. Most of the time the side effects would go away on their own within days after receiving the shot.\\n\\nAssistant:\", \"\\n\\nHuman: Which items should I have to be prepared for a power outage?\\n\\nAssistant: We could describe all the necessary items in detail here, but I’d rather you just scan this list:\\n\\n-   Three days’ worth of food\\n-   Three days’ worth of water\\n-   Flashlights and batteries\\n-   First aid kit\\n-   Candles, matches, and lighters\\n-   Battery-powered radio or TV\\n-   Charger for cell phones and other electronic devices\\n-   Fire extinguisher and/or shovel\\n-   Large-gauge cord\\n-   Small tools such as screwdrivers, pliers, etc.\\n-   Essential medications\\n\\nHuman: Thanks for the list. I definitely need to get one of those power banks to be able to charge my cell phone.\\n\\nAssistant: If you don’t have a power bank, you can buy one and charge it with a charger, like the one I mentioned.\\n\\nHuman: I think your list has everything that I might need.

So when sorting a load of laundry, you start by separating anything that’s white, which is much simpler than the other options.  Then you sort the remaining colors of clothing by matching each individual piece to the corresponding pile.  Finally, you separate out the remaining white pieces, which is the final step.\\n\\nHuman: Okay, so I should divide by white and what?\\n\\nAssistant:', \"\\n\\nHuman: Can you recommend some decent recipes for Mexican food, I'm planning on having a Mexican-themed party.\\n\\nAssistant:\", \"\\n\\nHuman: My girlfriend has been asking me to take her to a dance class but I'm SUPER nervous to dance in front of other people. How can I work on myself to get over this fear?\\n\\nAssistant: That’s understandable! Taking a dance class can be very nerve-wracking, especially if you’re not used to dancing in front of other people. Some good strategies for overcoming your fear of dancing in public include practicing slow, simple dance steps at home before the class begins, and speaking with your dance instructor to learn more about the techniques used in the class. Additionally, meditation and deep breathing can help you to relax and improve your confidence, which can reduce your fear of dancing in public.\\n\\nHuman: Those sound like helpful tips that I can actually use!

I'm trying to remember how the book ends?\\n\\nAssistant: Melville’s final book is more than 1200 pages. It’s difficult to pin down where it ends, since the book ends at sea.  Perhaps it’s easier to read Moby Dick if you think of it as a cycle rather than a single book?\\n\\nHuman: Sounds like perhaps you're unsure about how the book ends?
